# OVRUI

OVRUI is a framework containing everything necessary to build WebVR
applications. It contains a Player which wraps any Three.js scene and allows
it to be explored on desktop, on mobile devices, and in VR headsets. It also
contains logic for rendering 3d scenes, including view hierarchies and text
rendering using Signed-Distance Function fonts.
